Alexa Skill for TriMet Arrivals, written in NodeJS.

## Usage

"Alexa, ask TriMet about stop 755."
"Alexa, ask TriMet to get next arrivals for bus 20 at stop 755."
etc.

(See /speechAssets for the intent schema and sample utterances)

## Future

* Yes, I need to add unit tests.
* Currently, requires routes to be specified numerically, but I'm planning on adding support for addresses via the Google Maps Geocode API.
